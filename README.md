Mobile App Developer

Hello there! I'm Markaz Gasimov, a passionate Mobile App Developer with a focus on Flutter and Dart. Creating both iOS and Android applications is my forte. I rely on Hive for efficient local database management and turn to Firebase to handle the backend aspects. I'm on a perpetual journey of self-improvement in this ever-evolving field, constantly learning and expanding my skill set.

Here's a glimpse of what I bring to the table:

Flutter Enthusiast: Flutter and Dart are my creative playgrounds, where I bring app ideas to life with a touch of innovation.

Cross-Platform Proficiency: I excel in developing apps that seamlessly run on both iOS and Android, saving time and resources.

Data Magic with Hive: I harness Hive to manage local databases efficiently, ensuring data is readily available for your apps.

Firebase Wizardry: For all things backend, Firebase is my go-to solution, enabling real-time database management, user authentication, and cloud functions.

I'm on a perpetual quest for knowledge and growth, dedicated to refining my craft. Every day presents an opportunity to learn something new, and I'm committed to making the most of it. Let's connect, collaborate, and make amazing apps together.
